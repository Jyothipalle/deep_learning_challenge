# ANALYSIS OVERVIEW

The purpose of the analysis is to create a deep learning neural network model to predict whether or not the charities were successful when applying for the grant. The information that we used to train this model was from the charities data csv file as shown below.


# Data Preprocessing
The variabe the tos the target for this model is the IS_SUCCESSFUL variable as that is the variable that we are looking to predict using our model. The Faetures of the model are the remaining columns in the dataframe execpt for the IS_SUCCESSFUL variable as that is the target. I have also removed the EIN column as this is neither a target or a feature of this dataset.




# Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
